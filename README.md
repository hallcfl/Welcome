# Welcome

This is the README for the GitHub repositories of Antwand T. Howard.

Mr. Howard was the creator behind large video game projects such as Fearfied and Ballland Battles: Deluxe/Legacy, the codes of which have been lost. What remains of Ballland Battles: Legacy is the source code behind its multiplayer server.

Other projects created were a Hebrew Torah reading app with translation capability, and various command-line applications.

In the future, not much is expecting to be made, as code is becoming less relevant outside of the cybersecurity and web app development sectors. Most important functions of society also already have apps.
